# Network Security Lab - Cybersecurity Internship Part 2

Welcome to the Network Security Lab repository! This project documents hands-on cybersecurity exercises covering reconnaissance, network scanning, vulnerability assessment, packet analysis, and firewall configuration.


## 🎯 Lab Objectives

This network security lab covers the following key areas:

### 1️⃣ Reconnaissance
- Perform WHOIS lookups
- Conduct DNS queries with nslookup
- Use Shodan for internet-connected device discovery
- Apply Google dorking techniques
- Execute network ping sweeps
- Perform banner grabbing

### 2️⃣ Network Scanning with Nmap
- TCP SYN scan (-sS)
- UDP scan (-sU)
- Service version detection (-sV)
- Operating system detection (-O)
- Aggressive scan (-A)
- Document findings comprehensively

### 3️⃣ Vulnerability Scanning
- Set up and configure OpenVAS
- Run comprehensive vulnerability scans
- Analyze scan results
- Generate detailed reports
- Prioritize remediation efforts

### 4️⃣ Packet Analysis with Wireshark
- Capture and analyze HTTP traffic
- Demonstrate FTP credential interception
- Examine DNS queries
- Detect SYN flood attacks
- Understand network protocols

### 5️⃣ Firewall Configuration
- Configure iptables rules
- Implement allow/accept rules
- Set up deny/drop rules
- Manage and list firewall rules
- Apply security best practices
